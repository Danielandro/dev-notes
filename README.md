# Today I learned

Following the practice of [@aniasobo](https://github.com/aniasobo), [@jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) and [@charliegerard](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes).

A collection of small and not so small nuggets of knowledge encountered during my neverending learning journey. The aim is to keep it short and summarise concepts and ideas for reference - and to share with others!
